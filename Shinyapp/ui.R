One obvious reason for such increase in demand is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on work and school. Suddenly, many people were forced to continue working and attending school using web based communication systems such as Zoom.

                                     This trend is similar for all localities. In Chesapeake, there seems to be less vulnerability in areas of health insurance, transportation, technology access, unemployment, and poverty rate. On the other hand, there is a high vulnerability for income/wealth accumulation, welfare assistance, and educational attainment. Given that each jurisdiction in Hampton Roads has a separate municipality, it may be more insightful to analyze the rankings of the indicators within localities rather than making comparisons across localities to inform policymaking.

                   media/entertainment (news anchors & radio stations), and people/values pillars (religion). The Spring 2022 Capstone team added onto the pillars of media and entertainment, 
                   policy and justice, & people and values. Emily investigated internet covergae & quality under media and entertainment, Zhenming covered gentrification under policy and justice, 
                   and Allison analyzed financial literacy under people and values.  All of the remaining accrediation for work completed remains with the VT DSPG team and program. The Fall 2022
                   Capstone team expanded the Media/Entertainment pillar with analysis of qualitative data. The Fall 22 team's contributions include text analysis of local newspaper articles and 
                   media through Natural Language Processing to understand the sentiment of Black communities in Hampton Roads media. In the Spring 2023 semester, CMDA's Capstone group expanded upon
                   the people/values pillar by researching food insecurity and food assistance within the Hampton Area. Contributions include detailed maps about poverty rates, food deserts,
