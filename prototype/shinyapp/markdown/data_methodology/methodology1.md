Educational attainment is a major contributor to improving an individuals economic well-being and standard of living. As such, we examine the disparities in educational attainment to determine the economic progress of the Black community.
                                              Specifically, we collected data on on-time high school graduation rates and bachelors degree attainment. We also include the racial/ethnic representation of educators. Research indicates some distinct, albeit small, advantages when black students are paired with a Black teacher [1]. Suspension rate was also included in our analysis as some students are more likely to be disciplined than others even for the same transgression (KIDS Count).
                                              Moreover, a higher suspension rate will limit educational attainment, given the negative effect on achievement [2].
