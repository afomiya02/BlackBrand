We used the American Community Census data (ACS) to better understand the population in Hampton Roads and Virginia. 
The ACS is a yearly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and provides detailed demographic information about American households. 
We collected the 5-year estimates over the period 2010-2019 (NOTE: only include 2022 data or create slider?) to compute the percent of Hampton Roads residents in each locality by race and age. 
This information is also presented for the state of Virginia.

The black population accounts for 34% of the total population in Hampton Roads. This is significantly greater than Virginiaâ€™s which is about 19%. (NOTE: include VA data?)

The age composition for the Hampton Roads region appears to be representative of Virginia's population. However, there are variations by localities. For example, Williamsburg is by far the locality with the youngest median age at 24.6 years whereas the average median age is 39.6 years, and Mathews County has the largest median age at 53.7 years, with a larger presence of senior citizens. This could be indicative of differing economic and educational activities across Hampton Roads.
