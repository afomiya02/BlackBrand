We used the American Community Census data (ACS) to better understand the population in Hampton Roads and Virginia. 
The ACS is a yearly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau provides detailed demographic information about American household. 
We collected the 5-year estimates over the period 2010-2019 to compute the percent of Hampton Roads residents in each locality by race and age. 
This information is also presented for the state of Virginia.

The black population accounts for about 30% of the total population in Hampton Roads. This is significantly greater than Virginiaâ€™s which is about 19%.

The age composition for the Hampton Roads region appears to be representative of Virginia's population. However, there are variations by localities. 
For example, there exists a large population of young adults (ages 18 to 29) in Southampton County, whereas Portsmouth has a larger population of seniors - 
individuals 65 years and older. This data suggests that such ages difference may play a role in the differences in economic or education indicators across localities.
