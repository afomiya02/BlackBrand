In 2019, the Black community had a median annual income of $52,596, which is less than the median income of $67,387 of Hampton Roadâ€™s general population. This gap is consistent with the state trend, although it is larger at the state level, where the Black and general households earn $51,654 and $74,222, respectively.

While there are racial differences in median income, the gap between the Black community and the general population has been closing over the last decade. In 2010, the racial median income gap in Hampton Roads was $17,121, whereas it was $14,791 in 2019. This suggests that despite the lower median income, the Black community's economic status has slightly improved over the last decade.
