Health insurance is critical for preventative and emergency care and is considered a key component of financial security.  Since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed in 2010, uninsured rates have fallen across the country. Similarly, the percentage rate for Virginias dropped from 12.3% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019. The rates for Black Virginians were higher - in 2012, 15.4% were uninsured, whereas, in 2019, it was 10.1%. 

The Black population of Hampton Roads showed similar trajectories to the national and state trends, with most localities showing a fairly linear falling trend.  The most dramatic change occurred in the later years, particularly in 2018 and 2019, when several localities almost or more than halved their Black uninsured rate.Most dramatically, in Franklin City, more than a quarter of the Black population (25.8%) was uninsured in 2012. By 2019, 7.3% were uninsured, a difference of 18.5 percentage points.

While almost all localities showed declines, many rates remained higher than the state average.Norfolk consistently remained above the state average (20.7% uninsured in 2012 to 13.8% in 2019) despite a decreasing trend. On the other hand, Chesapeake and Virginia Beach consistently had lower rates than state averages. York had by far the lowest rates over time for an area with proportional Black representation.

Several exceptions to the general pattern also emerged. Mathews showed an increasing trend of Black residents uninsured, ranging from a relative low of 18.7% in 2013 to the highest level in 2019 at 32.4%. In stark contrast, all Black residents of Poquoson were consistently insured across the decade. Such differences may be due to the areas' small Black population.

Several important policy changes, as well as economic improvement following the Great Recession, may explain some of the patterns.  Full implementation of the ACA started in 2014, and in 2018 Virginia expanded Medicaid under the ACA.  Thus, there may be further improvements in future data.
