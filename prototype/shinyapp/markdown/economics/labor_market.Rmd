We examine the economic health of the labor market for the Black communities in Hampton Roads. First, we look at the top two industries that explain the highest number of workers in the region. This allows us to understand the employment landscape of the region, which may provide insights into vulnerable areas. We then analyze unemployment to understand the economic hardship that households in the Hampton Region face.

**Industries that employ the largest number of workers**

Majority of the residents in the Hampton region were employed in the Educational Services, health care, and social services sector. Among each locality in Hampton Roads, educational services, health care, and social services was one of the top two industries that employ the highest number of workers. However, for the other top employable industry, there are some slight variations across localities and time.For example, in 2012, eight of the 16 localities top two sector was in retail trade. However, only two areas had retail trade in the top two industries indicating more economic diversity among the localities over time.

**Are there differences in the unemployment rate across localities?**

The unemployment rate for the Black population in Hampton Roads tends to be greater than the average rate in Virginia, regardless of the time period. For example, in 2019, Franklin-which had the highest unemployment rate in the region- the unemployment rate for the black community was 14.9 % compared with Virginia's average of 4.6%. Moreover, regardless of localities, the Black community is more likely to be unemployed than the other residents. In 2019, the Black population had a higher unemployment rate than their counterparts in every county and city in the Hampton Roads region, even in areas that were below the state's average (Gloucester).

While for some counties there has been a decline in unemployment rates across the decade (2010-2019) for Black households, there still exists some significant disparity for most counties/cities. One such example is Williamsburg County that in 2010 had a similar unemployment rate for both Blacks and the region residents, 6.0% and 6.1%, respectively. But by 2019, that gap widen significantly by 4.6 percentage points (the Black unemployment rate was 10.4% and the total population 5.8%)
