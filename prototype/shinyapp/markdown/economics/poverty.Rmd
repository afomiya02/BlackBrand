It is clear that regardless of location the Black population has borne a higher rate of poverty than other races by about 7-8 percentage points between 2012-2019. Still, Hampton Roads has endured somewhat higher rates over the years. In 2019, 11.3% of people in Hampton Roads were in poverty, 0.7 percentage points higher than in Virginia overall. And among the Black population, the gap (1.2 percentage points) was even wider. In 2012, the gaps were smaller, but since then has gotten wider, indicating a deterioration in economic circumstances, especially for the Black population.

**Is poverty more prevalent in some counties or cities in Hampton Roads than others?**

It appears that, even at the county or city level, the Black population is always more likely to be in poverty than other residents. The disparity has been pronounced and persistent for most counties/cities. Most notably, Mathews has experienced a poverty gap that has grown from about 6 percentage points in 2012 to 30 percentage points in 2019. On the other hand, some counties/cities have enjoyed a significant decline in poverty rates and gaps over time, notably Franklin City. The city had a poverty rate of roughly 36% among Blacks compared to 23% in its entire population in 2012. But by 2019, the rate decreased markedly for both groups to 22% and 15% respectively, cutting the poverty gap by half over the 8-year period.
