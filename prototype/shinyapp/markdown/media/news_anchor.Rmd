Throughout the Hampton Roads region, there are three major local news channels: WAVY, WTKR, and Channel 13 News. Here we are looking at the race of the news anchors by gender, role, and channel. From the three news channels, there are a total of 90 news anchors. By looking at the pie chart, we can see that the majority of the news anchors (70%) were White and a quarter of the anchors (24.4%) were Black. The other 5% were either of Latin or Asian descent.

By looking at the graphic that displays Gender vs. Ethnicity, we can see that there were more Black female anchors than Black male anchors. This opposes the pattern that is displayed by the White anchors. This could be due to more Black females being in that profession in the area.

By looking at the graphic displaying Ethnicity vs. Role, we can see that the two most concentrated positions are news anchors, reporters, and meteorologists. Black news anchors were not that many less than the White news anchors, however there seems to be around 3 times more White news reporters and meteorologists than Black news reporters and meteorologists. By looking at the greater race distribution of Hampton Roads, the roles at the news channels compared to race are not a good representation of the community.

The last graphic shows Ethnicity Distribution by News Channel. Again, the most hired anchors are White across all channels, however WTKR has the least amount of Black news anchors. Another thing to notice is that WTKR has no anchors from any specific race group besides White and Black. The most racially inclusive channel seems to be Channel 13 based on the data that was collected.
