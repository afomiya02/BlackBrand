**Ratio of Diversity Bag to Positive & Negative Bags**

The ratios do tell us one part of the story, but to align with the 150 Year Plan we wanted to see if there was an intersection that can tell us a different story. We can see that most of the articles, regardless of sentiment, fall within the 0.1% diversity ratio. There is also almost an equal number of positive and negative sentiment articles that have a higher diversity ratio, and this is where we can find some significant information. While the number of articles are similar, if we the sentiment ratio for each article, we can understand the level of sentiment and how it compares to the diversity ratio. Overall, the positive sentiment is stronger in positive articles than the negative sentiment in negative articles for the same diversity ratio. And while we have three data points above the 0.2% diversity ratio (two of which have strong negative sentiment), it would be imprecise to say that there is more negative sentiment associated with diverse articles. What we can say is that articles from the Hampton Roads region have higher positive sentiment than negative sentiment for the same diversity ratios.

**Limitations**

Note to viewers and anyone who references this information, we have web scraped the diversity, positive, and negative word banks from online. We attempted as much as we could to well as containing our word bank to focus on racial and ethnic diversity. While diversity is intersectional, we believe that focusing on racial and ethnic diversity aligns best with Black BRAND’s 150 Year Plan. To prevent misleading the audience and keep things as transparent as possible, we have added our word banks under the “Data and Methodology” tab under “Overview.” In addition, these article prevent biases are exclusively about media, entertainment, arts, and technology. It is possible that we could have recorded sentiment of overall media in the region but would have been difficult with the given timeframe.
