What is played on the radio and where radio stations are located are telling of the community and what motivates the community. However, it is important to take into consideration that just because certain genres are usually dominated by a specific group/race, that doesnâ€™t mean that only that race listens to that type of music. Due to those reasons, we are focusing on where the radio stations are located. The cities/counties where the most radio stations are located usually indicates the most racially diverse neighborhoods.
