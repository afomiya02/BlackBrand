In the period of July 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021, a traffic stop was pulled describing the driverâ€™s racial background, age, gender, the severity of violation/action, and time of the incident. From these regions, excluding missing/incomplete data, there were over 16,000 traffic stops across the region, which averages roughly 35 stops daily. In this time span, 8642 African Americans have been recorded in the data, and 7656 Caucasians were the other majority with 219 who identified as Asian/Pacific Islander and 20 who identified as American Indian. The next visualizations will be further in-depth with county/city data on traffic stops identified by their age and racial background. Poquoson data is not on these graphs as their data was incomplete and not sufficient to be used in the matter as the other jurisdictions.

As in the graphs below, that reveal the number of citations and arrests made, the data vary between jurisdictions and it provides no clear answer on how the traffic stops provide insight on how the black community in the Hampton Roads region is treated. Future projects include additional information on traffic stops such as broadening the field of reasons for stops, researching other databases for matches or inconsistencies, and mapping high-interest locations for officers to be in position for stops.
