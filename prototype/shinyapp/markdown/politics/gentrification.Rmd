Using manually collected data regarding the average home value from last year by zip code in Hampton roads, the percentage of white population and the percentage of black population from the Five-year-plan. We found that all the zip codes that are all significantly more white than black. Also, the five zip codes with the lowest home values have a higher percent black population than white. For zip codes where houses are worth more than $400,000, the percentage of white residents was greater than the percentage of black residents. We also found zip codes for houses with a value of less than $200,000. The proportion of black residents in all but one zip code 23163 is greater than the proportion of white residents. These data give us a sense of the difference in value between predominantly black and predominantly white areas. Properties receive an appraisal value lower than the contract price in minority tracts compared to those in white tracts.
