## **Project Background**

The Black Business Research Analytics Networking and Development [(Black BRAND)](https://blackbrand.biz/) is a
non-profit organization operating in the Hampton Roads region. Established in 2016, the
primary goal of Black BRAND is to improve the values of the Black families and community
within the region.

Despite the overall economic growth in the United States, there is a significant
Black-white wealth gap. In 2019, the median white household was around $188,200 - 7.8
*times* that of the typical Black household of $24,100. As such, Black BRAND wants
to investigate the economic well-being of the Black community in Hampton Roads. Moreover,
given the recent increase in support for black businesses, it is important to determine
whether this has resulted in any economic improvement for the Black community.

Guided by our meetings with the Black BRAND stakeholders and Claud Anderson's PowerNomics model,
there are five main pillars to measure the overall economic and social progress of the
Black community in Hampton Roads.
