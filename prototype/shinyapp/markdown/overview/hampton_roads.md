## **Hampton Roads**

The [Hampton Roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads) area 
consists of ten cities and six counties in the Southeastern region of Virginia.
It is ranked as the 33rd largest metropolitan statistical srea (MSA) in the United States,
the 8th largest metro area in the Southeast region, and the 2nd largest between Atlanta and Washington, DC.

The jurisdictions of Hampton Roads are the cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Hampton,
Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, and Williamsburg,
and the counties of Gloucester, Isle of Wright, James City, Mathews, Southampton, and York.

The population of the Hampton Roads MSA has been growing over the last decade with an
estimated population of approximately 1.7 million in 2020, a 3% increase from 2010. This
region accounts for about 20% of Virginia’s state population.

Each jurisdiction in Hampton Roads has its own separate municipal government. While
there are consultations on regional issues, there are more than 20 elected independent
municipal governing bodies. As such, it is imperative for our project to examine not only
differences with the Virginia population but also within the localities of Hampton Roads.

Given its location, Hampton Roads has one of the world’s greatest natural harbors,
with the ability to accommodate the largest cargo ships on the planet.  It is also known
for its large military presence, shipping piers, and miles of waterfront property and beaches.
Moreover, due to the diversity of the localities, Hampton Roads have a diverse set of natural
resources assets including but not limited to 26 miles of Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake
Bay beaches, numerous state parks, wildlife refuges, Lake Drummond, and various rivers and waterways.
