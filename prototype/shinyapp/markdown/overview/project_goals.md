## **Project Goals**

Our team aims to create a dashboard that shows the state of the Black community in the 
Hampton Roads region. This will enable stakeholders to understand the myriad of past and 
current factors that affect the economic and social progress of Black households in Hampton Roads. 
As such, data-driven recommendations can be made to improve the well-being of our residents.

We identified, acquired, and used publicly available data to provide our stakeholders, 
Black BRAND, with a dashboard that shows a combined view of multiple indicators for the 
two pillars: Education and Economics.

Under the Education pillar, we collected indicators across three distict issues:
* Educators
* Eduational Attainment
* Suspension

Under the Economics pillar, we collected indicators across five distinct issues:
* Income/Wealth
* Labor Markets
* Homeownership
* Health
* Household Wellbeing

We conducted a cross-comparison analysis with our indicators across all counties and 
cities in Hampton Roads.  Our project also compares the Black population against the general 
population in Hampton Roads to determine whether racial differences exist within each locality. 
Moreover, we also present information for the general population in Virginia.

This dashboard compiles our findings and allows our stakeholders, and other interested 
users to explore the information dynamically.
