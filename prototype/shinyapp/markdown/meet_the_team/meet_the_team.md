### Virginia Tech Data Science for the Public Good

The **Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program** is a summer immersive program held at the **Virginia Tech Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics**. In its second year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy. For more information on program highlights, how to apply, and our annual symposium, please visit the official [VT DSPG website](https://aaec.vt.edu/academics/undergraduate/dspg.html).

### Virginia Tech CMDA Capstone Program

The Virginia Tech CMDA program draws on expertise from three primary departments at Virginia Tech with strengths in quantitative science: **Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science**. By combining elements of these disciplines in innovative, integrated courses that emphasize techniques at the forefront of applied computation, the program offers a rich suite of quantitative skills for tackling today's massive data-based problems.
