We retrieved several indicators using the 2019 5-year ACS estimates to examine the family dynamics of Black households in Hampton Roads. These characteristics are presented using interactive maps. Clicking on the tabs and selecting a variable populates the map. Hovering over the map displays the percentage of Black residents living in a specific city/county with the selected characteristics.

**The interactive map shows:**

Percentage of Black Children under the age of 18 that live in a female-headed household. We included this indicator as research has shown that female-headed households have a greater risk of poverty and are more likely to be food-insecure. In Hampton Roads, regardless of location, majority of Black households with children under 18 have a female as the head. For 7 of the 11 areas, over 50% of Black households for which data is available, is led by a female. This may suggest some family instability for half of the black children in the Hampton Roads region.
